# ArtExhibtionSystem
The Art Exhibition System is a web-based application built using Python (Flask framework), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with MySQL as the database. It is designed to manage art exhibitions efficiently by allowing users to explore artworks, view details, and book exhibition slots. The system also provides an admin portal for managing art entries, exhibition schedules, and user bookings, making it a complete solution for both visitors and organizers.

This project demonstrates full-stack web development using Flask as the backend framework and MySQL for data storage. It also incorporates responsive frontend design, database management, and user authentication features.
